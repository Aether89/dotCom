      <p>Magatama is a contemporary Mag Planner and Calculator designed for Phantasy Star Online made in VisualBasic.net. The idea for this
        program was conceived when I realized that I possessed the necessary skills to create an enhanced spiritual
        successor to ‘Mag Farm 0.9.7r2’ by James Baxter, which had begun to show signs of obsolescence.
