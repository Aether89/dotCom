      <h3><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17012" class="url">Pip-Boy Customisation Framework</a></h3>
      <p>Pip-Boy Customisation Framework aka <b>PBCF</b>was made to allow to edit the Pip-Boy look directly in-game. It
        predate the release of the official Bethesda implementation of the idea by a Year an 29 days. Even with the
        official support of in-game
        modification for the Pip-Boy this mods still have a purpose as it add Categories to filter paint job, abilities to
        change each part separetely rather than as a whole, Misc Mods and Dynamics Naming. PBCF only contains textures for
        the labels and
        the screens, other textures for the Pip-Boy are available as a separate mods.

      <h3><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8156" class="url">Pip-Boy Customisation Pack</a></h3>
      <p>Pip-Boy Customisation Pack aka <b>PBCP</b>While Pip-Boy Customisation Pack now require Pip-Boy Customisation
        Framework it actually predate it by 6 Month and 20 Days. Intitialy it was called Pip-Boy Customisation as it
        allowed to modify some parts
        of the Pip-Boy and served as a base for other to build on; However, i soon retooled it into the Pip-Boy
        Customisation Pack so that the basic Framework to modify the Pip-Boy would be it own thin and wouldn't require to
        download the rextextures
        i had made.

      <h2 class="game">Fallout : New Vegas</h2>
      <h3><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/59335" class="url">Vault-Tec Loading Wheel</a></h3>
      <p>While it actually is my third mod for Fallout: New Vegas, this is the only one that remain under my name. The
        idea was born when i realised that the default Roulette Loading wheel for Fallout: New Vegas was similar to the
        Vault-Tec Logo and if simply
        replaced the wheel part it would be a perfect match.

          href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/47285" class="url">Project Nevada - Extra Options</a></h3>
      <p>Whiles these mods two mods aren't develloped by me but by Gribbleshnibit8, i played a part in the history of the
        Project Nevada DLC Patches. I originally had made small patchs to add Project Nevada Functionality to the DLC and
        then Gribbleshnibit8
        improved on them. Nowadays the only trace of my involvement into these dlc patches is the Visor Overlay Textures
        for Salt-Upon-Wound's.

      <h2 class="game">The Elder Scrolls IV: OBLIVION </h2>
      <h3> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/35181" class="url">Mage of the Arena</a></h3>
      <p>This is my first mod ever. I made it when i had enought of being forced to wear a light or Heavy armor in the
        Imperial City Arena and wanted to be able to wear a mage robes while fighting as a mage. While not the only mods
        to add that functionality
        it is the only one at the time that when you selected the Mage Raiments you would have a voiced reactions by Owyn
        and Ysabel. Also at install it offer you two meshes options a custom edit of the vanilla mage robes to have the
        gloves and sandal
        of the Light Raiment made by me or the Mage Robe from Mage Equipments by Aknevrec.
