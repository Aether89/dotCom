# V1.1.0
## Changes 

### Deleted component HelloWord.vue ("src/components/HelloWorld.vue")
- Moved it content into Home.vue ("src/views/Home.vue").

### Languages.json ("src/i18n/*.json")
- Refactored the structure of the page information in the JSON.
- pages that were directly in `global` and `global.url` keys are now nested under a new `pages` key.
- Each page,is now an object with `name` and `url` keys.

### Languages.ts ("src/i18n/languages.ts")
- added an interface for how a language.json is expected to contain.

### Drawer Layout ("src/layouts/default/Drawer.vue")
- The avatar and the v-divider have been encapsulated within a div. 
- The v-if condition, which was initially on the router-link, has been moved to this newly created div
- The list of item to display in the drawer is obtained from the language files

## New Features
### Routing (¨src/router/index.ts")
- create route for each pages in the languages files,
    - path is the url.
    - name is name.
    - component is the key.


## Adding New Pages

Follow these steps to add a new page:

1. **Create a Vue File for the New Page**:
    - Navigate to the `src/view/` directory.
    - Create a new Vue file for the desired language.

2. **Register the New Page in Language Files**:
    - Navigate to the `src/i18n/` directory.
    - Under the `pages` key, add an entry for the new page. This entry should be an object with `name`, `url` and `icon` properties.

Here's an example of how to add a new page:

```javascript
// Example:
// pages = {
//   ...,
//   newPage: {
//     "name": "New Page",
//     "url": "/newpage"
//     "icon": "mdi-web-box"
//   },
//   ...
// };
```
Remember to replace `newPage`, `New Page`, and `/newpage` with the actual key, display name, and URL of your new page, respectively. The `...` indicates other page entries that might already exist in the `pages` object.

### Adding New Languages

1. **Create a JSON file for the new language**:
    - Navigate to the `src/i18n/` directory.
    - Create a new JSON file for the language you want to add. You can use an existing JSON file as a template.

```javascript
// For example, if you're adding Espanõl, you might create a `es.json` file.
```

2. **Import the new language file**:
    - Open the `src/i18n/languages.ts` file.
    - Import the JSON file you just created.

```javascript
// For example:
// import espanol from './es.json';
```

3. **Add the imported file to the `languages` constant**:
    - In the `languages.ts` file, add the imported file to the `languages` constant.

```javascript
// For example:
// const languages = {
//   ...en,
//   ...fr,
//   ...es,
// };
```

I see, thank you for the clarification. Here's the revised version of the instructions:

## Adding New Themes

1. **Create a JSON file for the new theme**:
    - Navigate to the `src/themes/` directory.
    - Create a new JSON file for the theme you want to add. You can use an existing JSON file as a template.

```javascript
// For example, if you're adding a lemon theme, you might create a `lemon.json` file.
```

2. **Import the new theme file**:
    - Open the `src/themes/myThemes.ts` file.
    - Import the JSON file you just created.

```javascript
// For example:
// import lemon from './lemon.json';
```

3. **Add the imported file to the `themes` object within the `myThemes` constant**:
    - In the `mythemes.ts` file, add the imported file to the `themes` object that is within the `myThemes` constant.

```javascript
// For example:
// const myThemes = {
//   defaultTheme: 'default',
//   themes: {
//     ...defaultTheme,
//     ...wasteland,
//     ...vampberry,
//     ...lemon,
//   },
// };
```
